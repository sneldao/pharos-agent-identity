## Title

**Ligis** — Portable on-chain identity and verifiable credentials for AI agents on Casper.

## Tagline (one-liner)

Ligis gives every AI agent a portable, revocable Casper-native identity plus signed EIP-712 capability credentials — the same `capabilityHash("kyc.basic")` on every chain — so x402 Trust Gates, RWA oracles, and DeFi protocols can finally ask "who are you, and who vouches for that?"

## Track

- [x] Casper Innovation Track
- [x] Agentic AI (Trust Steward runs an autonomous loop on Casper)
- [x] RWA (x402 Trust Gate delivers tokenized real-estate data, gated by Ligis credentials)
- [x] DeFi (autonomous x402 micropayments settled on Casper via EIP-712 TransferWithAuthorization)

## Category

**Agent Identity & Credentials** — uncommon in the field, foundation for other
Casper-native AI agents and x402 services. Also touches DeFi (micropayments)
and RWA (premium tokenized real-estate data).

## Long-form description (~700 words)

### Problem

The Casper AI Toolkit now ships MCP servers, an x402 protocol, and CSPR.cloud
APIs. But there is no portable, on-chain way for a Casper agent to say _who_
it is, _which wallet controls it_, and _who vouches for which capability_.
Without that, x402 services have to fall back to KYC-by-promise, RWA oracles
to trusted-list-by-handshake, and DeFi access control to allowlists managed
out of band.

### What we built

Two Odra contracts (Rust / Wasm 32) on Casper Testnet, plus a `ChainAdapter`
runtime that gives any agent a one-line primitive to gate access:

```rust
require(creds.is_capable(subject, capability_hash("agent.commerce.escrow")), "not allowed")
```

1. **`AgentId`** — soulbound-style identity. The agent mints its own NFT
   (`mint_self`) to a controller address. No transfer approvals. A
   one-way `rotate` for key recovery. `set_token_uri` lets the agent
   anchor a 0G Storage evidence root on chain.
2. **`CredentialRegistry`** — signed EIP-712 capability credentials
   (`issue`, `revoke`, `is_capable`). The capability name is hashed
   chain-neutrally (keccak256 in Solidity / `blake2b` for the Odra
   registry's `capabilityHash` helper) so the same `0x3896aa82..235f35e3e`
   identifies `kyc.basic` on every chain.

The Trust Steward wraps both contracts in an autonomous loop:

> **boot → reason → gate → act → re-gate → record**

1. **BOOT** — `AgentId.mint_self` on Casper
2. **REASON** — 0G Compute (Qwen 2.5 7B, TEE-verified) maps the goal
   to a list of required capabilities; falls back to `LocalReasoner`
   (keyword matcher) if 0G is unavailable
3. **GATE** — `CredentialRegistry.is_capable(subject, cap)` for each
4. **ACT** — Steward self-issues any missing capability via signed
   EIP-712 `CredentialRegistry.issue` calls
5. **RE-GATE** — confirm all required credentials are now valid
6. **RECORD** — Upload evidence manifest to 0G Storage, anchor the
   root hash to Casper via `AgentId.set_token_uri`

The same loop runs on Pharos Atlantic (Solidity) and Casper Testnet (Odra)
because the Steward consumes a `ChainAdapter` interface, not an
implementation.

### x402 Trust Gate (the consumption of that trust)

A separate `x402-server` package implements one endpoint, `GET /premium`,
that requires a valid Ligis credential AND an x402 micropayment:

- no credential → **401** (request credential from Steward first)
- credential, no payment → **402** with x402 v2 PaymentRequirements
  (scheme: exact, network: casper:casper-test, 1 CSPR)
- credential + signed EIP-712 `TransferWithAuthorization` → **200**
  with tokenized RWA market data, payment settled on chain

Local settlement mode produces a real CSPR transfer on Casper Testnet
(visible above as `27a9ac88..`). The CSPR.cloud x402 facilitator
is wired as an alternative settlement path for production.

### Cross-chain portability (the differentiating claim)

`capabilityHash("kyc.basic")` produces the same 32-byte hash on
Pharos Atlantic (Solidity keccak256) and Casper Testnet (Odra
`Hasher::finalize` via `blake2b` for chain-native primitives).
The same secp256k1 issuer key can sign a credential on both
chains, and the signature verifies on either because the
EIP-712 domain separator is per-chain (chain name + contract
package hash). A demo at `scripts/cross-chain-credential-demo.ts`
shows the same `0x3896aa82..235f35e3e` from both chains with
the same issuer EVM address.

### Use of the Casper AI Toolkit

- **Odra 2.8.1** — contracts (AgentId, CredentialRegistry)
- **x402 protocol** — Trust Gate endpoint + EIP-712 client
- **CSPR.cloud** — RPC for tests, optional facilitator
- **0G Compute** — TEE-verified LLM for the reasoner (Qwen 2.5 7B)
- **0G Storage** — evidence anchoring with on-chain root
- **MCP** — `mcp-server` package exposes the same gate as a
  discoverable agent tool (with `chain="casper"` branch)

## Long-term launch plan

- Track active capability issuers on `ligis.vercel.app` (already
  live, chain-aware at `?chain=casper-testnet`)
- Promote `0xB85D3E...` to a public-good issuer for `kyc.basic`
  on Casper Mainnet once Buildathon results land
- Publish a public Casper Mainnet deploy of `AgentId` and
  `CredentialRegistry` in Q3 2026
- Co-author an EIP-712 standard for chain-neutral capability
  hashes with the Casper and Pharos teams (cross-chain
  reputation is the obvious next step)
