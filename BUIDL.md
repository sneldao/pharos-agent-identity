## Title

**Ligis** — on-chain agent ID + EIP-712 capability credentials, on Atlantic testnet

## Tagline (one-liner)

Give every AI agent a portable, revocable identity and signed capability
attestations, on Pharos Atlantic — so the rest of the agent economy can finally
ask "who are you, and who vouches for that?"

## Track

- [x] Pharos Skill Engine
- [x] Agent & x402 (composability)

## Repo

`https://github.com/sneldao/pharos-agent-identity`

## Live demo (Loom / YouTube)

`<Loom URL>` (record after deploy)

## Deployed contracts (Pharos Atlantic testnet — live)

- **PharosAgentID** (ERC-721 soulbound-style): `0xbd163Be6882CF6DE54bA10d726F4f619Bdc28a89`
  - Pharos Scan: https://atlantic.pharosscan.xyz/address/0xbd163Be6882CF6DE54bA10d726F4f619Bdc28a89
- **CredentialRegistry** (EIP-712 attestations): `0x9E6eC93200E185c11423eb3A5150449D49d3473A`
  - Pharos Scan: https://atlantic.pharosscan.xyz/address/0x9E6eC93200E185c11423eb3A5150449D49d3473A

## End-to-end demo txs (executed live on Atlantic)

The full `scripts/demo.sh` flow ran on the live testnet:

| Step | Action | Tx hash | Result |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| 1 | `mintSelf` for the demo subject | `0x9313e4d8e8a7a1bf07b97e0e1490f8c43bea20bd1baf578b1cf99fb8b7c98bc6` | tokenId 1 minted |
| 2 | `issue` (EIP-712) for `agent.commerce.escrow` | `0x9728f0a71ac3e6af1065db2f17a35ff32341e99c4c0c339dca93ead1154a61db` | CredentialIssued |
| 3 | `isCapable(subject, capability)` | view call | `true` |
| 4 | `revoke` (issuer action) | `0x00e6a047078042ec65148dab59730eaf6e8b94bfb6379cd143f08eafc8d3e3bf` | CredentialRevoked |
| 5 | `isCapable(subject, capability)` | view call | `false` |
| 6 | `rotate(tokenId, newController)` | `0x55c96cab0cc17318b01746df0a67f55f5521a61d41f8092273917ce33529029e` | ownerOf(1) = newController |

## Deployer wallet (for reference)

`0xd21a4c7ab1a52a2Ab48A6f0271984d5c3D4027Ec` — used to broadcast all six demo txs. Key is in
`.env.d/deployer.env` (gitignored). This wallet is NOT a hot wallet, do not reuse for mainnet.

## Category

**Agent Identity & Credentials** (uncommon in the field, foundation for other Skills)

## Description (long-form, ~600 words)

### Problem

Every other Skill in the hackathon asks "is this agent allowed to do X?" and
answers with nothing. There is no portable, on-chain way for a Pharos agent
to say *who* it is, *which wallet controls it*, and *who vouches for which
capability*. Without that, escrow, KYC, accredited-investor gating, rate
limits, and reputation are all built on a trust-me-bro foundation.

### What we built

A two-contract Skill that gives every Pharos agent:

1. **A portable, soulbound Agent ID** — an ERC-721 NFT minted to a controller
   address, with no transfer approvals and a one-way `rotate()` for key
   recovery. The same agent identity survives wallet migrations.

2. **EIP-712 capability credentials** — third-party issuers (KYC provider,
   marketplace, regulator) sign off-chain attestations of the form
   `(issuer, subject, capability, expiresAt, nonce)`. The `CredentialRegistry`
   verifies the signature and stores the credential. A second
   `isCapable(subject, capability)` view checks the *latest* valid credential
   for that pair, including revocation.

### Why this matters for the Dual Cascade

Phase 2's bounty payout and x402 stack all want to gate flows by agent
identity. Aegis (escrow), Pact (cross-chain), Farolink (data feeds), and the
x402 facilitators in the hackathon all currently use
"wallet address as identity" — which breaks the moment a key rotates, and
which has no way to revoke a leaked wallet. This Skill is the missing trust
layer.

### What's actually shipped

- **2 Solidity contracts** (`PharosAgentID.sol`, `CredentialRegistry.sol`)
  on Pharos Atlantic (chainId 688689), 100% Foundry test coverage (41 tests, including fuzz tests).
- **CLI** (`dist/cli/index.js`): 8 commands (info, hash, issue, verify, revoke,
  rotate, sign, agent run) — every command prints JSON for downstream Skills to consume.
- **MCP server** (`dist/mcp/server.js`): 7 tools that an agent can call
  directly from Claude Code or any MCP-aware IDE.
- **Trust Steward Agent** (`src/agent/`): an autonomous agent that runs the full
  loop — boot (mint Agent ID) → reason (0G Compute TEE-verified LLM maps a
  natural-language goal to required capabilities) → gate (`isCapable`) → act
  (self-issue missing credentials) → record (write evidence manifest to 0G
  Storage, anchor the Merkle root on-chain via `setTokenURI`). 17 TypeScript
  unit tests (node:test) with mocked clients verify the full loop offline.
- **0G integration** (`src/zerog/`): `compute.ts` wraps the 0G Compute serving
  broker for TEE-verified inference; `storage.ts` wraps the 0G Storage SDK for
  verifiable evidence storage. Both sit behind interfaces (`Reasoner`,
  `EvidenceStore`) so the agent is testable offline.
- **Shared library** (`src/lib/`): single source of truth for all on-chain
  operations — `issueId`, `verify`, `revoke`, `rotate`, `signCredential`,
  `getAgentId`, `submitCredential`, `updateTokenUri`. CLI, MCP, and Agent all
  import from here (no duplicated chain logic).
- **SKILL.md + 7 references** (issue/verify/revoke/rotate/hash/sign/composability) following
  the Pharos Skill Engine's director pattern. The composability reference is the
  integration playbook for Aegis, Pact, FaroLink, Maestro, and x402 facilitators.
- **install.sh** that wires the CLI + MCP into Claude Code and Codex in 30 s.
- **bash scripts** (deploy, verify, demo) that go from `git clone` to a
  live demo on Atlantic testnet in under 5 minutes.

### Composability with the other Skills

Every Phase 1 Skill in the hackathon needs the same answer to the same
question: "should this agent be allowed to do X?" Today, every Skill
implements its own ad-hoc allowlist. With this Skill, the answer is one
external call:

```solidity
require(creds.isCapable(subject, keccak256("agent.commerce.escrow")), "not allowed");
```

- **Aegis** (escrow, BUIDL 45339) → check `isCapable(counterparty, "agent.commerce.escrow")`
  before opening an escrow; the registry can revoke a compromised counterparty
  without touching open escrows. See `references/composability.md` for the 3-line
  Aegis contract patch.
- **Pact** (cross-chain, BUIDL 45334) → bind an agent ID on each chain to the same
  off-chain DID; the registry's `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is chain-specific so a signed
  attestation is non-replayable across chains.
- **FaroLink** (data feeds) → gate premium feeds behind
  `isCapable(subscriber, "data.premium")` and RWA swaps behind
  `isCapable(trader, "rwa.accredited")`.
- **Maestro** (recurring mandates) → recurring mandate flows need
  `isCapable(payer, "agent.commerce.recurring")`.
- **Any x402 facilitator** (Phase 2) → check
  `isCapable(payer, "agent.commerce.x402")` before signing a 402 challenge.

The dual cascade works like this: the **identity cascade** is this Skill
(the registry + the agent ID). The **commerce cascade** is Aegis/Pact/FaroLink
calling `isCapable(subject, capabilityHash)` to gate their flows. With this
Skill shipping, the other 5+ Phase 1 Skills can stop re-implementing access
control and start composing.

### Final hardening pass (post-review)

After an internal audit, the following improvements were applied:

- **ERC-721 compliance**: `PharosAgentID` now emits standard `Transfer` events on `mint`, `rotate`, `revoke`, and `transferFrom`, making the NFT fully trackable by indexers, marketplaces, and wallet UIs.
- **`safeTransferFrom` safety**: Added `IERC721Receiver` checks so transfers to contracts that do not implement `onERC721Received` revert cleanly (previously it was just a passthrough to `transferFrom`).
- **ABI event alignment**: The TypeScript ABI (`src/lib/abi.ts`) now matches the exact Solidity event names (`AgentMinted`, `AgentRotated`, `AgentRevoked`, `MetadataUpdated`), fixing silent event-decoding failures.
- **Bounded registry scans**: `CredentialRegistry.revoke` now scans at most 50 nonces when recomputing the latest valid credential, preventing unbounded gas griefing. `latestCredential` and `getCredential` no longer iterate backward — they use O(1) existence flags and exact nonce lookups.
- **O(1) issuer-specific checks**: `isCapableFromIssuer` now reads from a per-issuer latest-valid nonce tracker instead of iterating backward, making it safe for on-chain callers.
- **Fuzz tests**: Added 3 Foundry fuzz tests covering valid signature issuance, wrong-nonce rejection, and revocation edge cases (256 runs each).
- **Documentation fix**: `SKILL.md` and `README.md` now correctly state that credentials are wallet-bound and must be re-issued after key rotation.
- **Capability hashes**: `assets/credentials.example.json` now contains actual `keccak256` hashes instead of placeholder values.
- **Forge path resolution**: Added `scripts/forge.sh` wrapper that finds Foundry's forge at `~/.foundry/bin/forge` (avoids shadowing by other `forge` CLIs). All npm scripts and deploy/verify scripts use it.
- **0G Compute SDK fix**: The SDK's ESM build has a broken re-export; `compute.ts` now imports via `createRequire` to use the working CJS build.
- **Pharos Scan verify script**: Updated to the correct socialscan API endpoint, `solidity-single-file` format, `cancun` EVM version, and correct solc commit hash.
- **Batch capability reads**: `isCapableMulti(address, bytes32[])` returns `bool[]` in a single call — the Trust Steward's GATE phase now uses 1 RPC instead of N for capability checks. The frontend `readAgentSnapshot` also uses this, and the VerifyDemo has a batch mode toggle.
- **AgentCapabilityChanged event**: Emitted on `issue` (capable=true) and `revoke` (capable=true/false) so indexers and frontends get real-time trust state changes without polling.
- **ERC-165 support**: `CredentialRegistry` now implements `supportsInterface(bytes4)` for trustless composition — other Skills can verify the registry interface before calling it.

### Security posture

- Soulbound: `setApprovalForAll`, `approve`, and `transferFrom` to non-owners
  are blocked. The only way to change controller is `rotate(tokenId, newAddr)`.
- Replay protection: every credential has an issuer-scoped nonce; `issue`
  reverts on duplicates.
- Cross-chain safety: `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` mixes the chainId, so a signed
  attestation for Atlantic can't be replayed on mainnet.
- Revocation: only the original issuer can revoke; revocation is
  irreversible; `isCapable` correctly handles the "newer valid credential
  exists" case.

### What's intentionally NOT in scope (Phase 2 candidates)

- Smart-account issuers (the registry today expects an EOA signer; a
  Safe-module wrapper is the obvious Phase 2 add).
- Zero-knowledge capability proofs (a user can already prove "I have a
  valid `kyc.accredited` credential" by showing a Merkle path; this is a
  Halo2 / Noir follow-up).
- On-chain reputation scoring (we expose the raw data; Aegis/Pact can
  build the score).
- Phase 1 → mainnet migration script is included as a one-liner
  (`./scripts/deploy.sh mainnet` once we have a mainnet deployer key).
- ENS / off-chain identity bridging: agent metadata can resolve an ENS name
  for human-readable issuer identification; web3.bio and similar services can
  enrich agent profiles with social reputation without touching the on-chain
  credential layer.
